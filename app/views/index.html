        <p class="govuk-body">I am a senior quality assurance engineer who specialises in the accessible design of high-profile government services in agile teams. With a broad range of design, research, test and code skills, I would like to expand my career into full-time interaction design.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">For over two years I have had a keen interest and direct input into the user centred design of major Defra digital services. In parallel, I have built experience and knowledge in web design and prototyping.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">I am a friendly, flexible and hard-working part of any team while freely challenging any decisions which are not in the interest of a service’s users.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">I work closely and proactively with our team’s interaction and content designers. This ensures that the proposed designs are accessible, clear and usable, helping prevent issues before they arise in development. Both designers actively seek my input and proof reading before delivering a prototype.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">I am confident in using and adapting HTML, CSS and simple JavaScript to create accessible websites including my own, <a href="https://www.andrewhick.com">andrewhick.com</a> and <a href="http://www.imageteksystems.co.uk">imageteksystems.co.uk</a>.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">I regularly participate in user research activities and have conducted lab sessions with external users. In my QA role, I am responsible for ensuring that the end product can be traced back to user needs.</p>
